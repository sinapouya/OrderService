🚀 Continuing the Microservices Journey: OrderService Implementation 🚀
Hello again, LinkedIn family! 👋 I'm excited to share the second part of my microservices journey, focusing on the implementation of the OrderService microservice. If you missed the first part, check it out here https://lnkd.in/ea9dECtE
🌐 Project Overview:
In this phase, I've introduced the OrderService microservice, a crucial component in our evolving shopping application. The OrderService is responsible for handling customer orders, providing essential functionalities like order placement.
📂 Project Structure:
Controller: The OrderController serves as the entry point for order-related operations. It receives requests and delegates them to the corresponding service methods.
Service Layer: The OrderEntityService is the heart of the business logic. It handles processes such as order placement, interacting with the repository for data persistence.
DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): The OrderDto and OrderItemDto ensure seamless communication between layers, providing a structured format for order-related data.
Repository: Leveraging Spring Data JPA, the OrderEntityRepository facilitates smooth interactions with the MySQL database for storing order information.
🔧 Tech Stack:
Building upon the foundation of Spring Boot and MySQL, the OrderService continues to harness the power of these technologies. I've also utilized Lombok for streamlined Java development.
🛠️ Testing:
A comprehensive set of tests has been incorporated using JUnit 5 and Testcontainers. These tests ensure the reliability and correctness of the order placement process.
🐙 GitHub Repository:

🛠️ How to Run:

To facilitate a smooth experience, I've added Docker Compose to the project.

⭐ Star the Repository:
If you find this project intriguing, I'd greatly appreciate your support! ⭐ Starring the repository on GitHub helps spread the knowledge within our community.
